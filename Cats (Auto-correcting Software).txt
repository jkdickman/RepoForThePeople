I must keep this school project private in the name of Academic Honesty. But happy to share it privately to interested employers.

Cats (Auto-correcting Software) â€“ a program that measures typing speed and features an autocorrect function that attempts to correct the spelling of a word after a user types it. Project inspired by typeracer.
